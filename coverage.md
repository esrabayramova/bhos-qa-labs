# Branch and Line Coverage

In our project, we are running automated tests and unit tests. S, how well do these tests work? Is there a guarantee that these tests can be used as verification that your code is working correctly? At this point, we will use a metric called coverage.

Branch coverage indicates whether the branches are covered by the tests - how much percentage of them is covered? The higher the coverage is, the better the testing is exercised. If the coverage is low, it means that your application lacks testing and that there might be defects in the areas that are not covered. In the other hand, line coverage shows how much percentage of the lines of the code is covered by the unit tests.

In our project, we are using SonarCloud which is a code quality and security service.
